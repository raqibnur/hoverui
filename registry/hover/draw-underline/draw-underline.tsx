   * type-check, and offering a tag whose own attributes the type rejects is worse than not
   * offering it. For a button, render this as a `span` inside your `<button>` and drive the
   * keyboard state from the button's own `:focus-visible`.

 * Technique (SCOPE §10, G5, G12, G15).
 *
 * The rule is described as the span it covers — `translateX(a) scaleX(b - a)` off a fixed
 * left origin — rather than as a scale with a flipped `transform-origin`.
 *
 * SCOPE §10's `*Technique:*` line suggests flipping the origin, and that is the obvious
 * reading, but it cannot express an interrupted gesture. Flipping the origin at scale `s`
 * moves the painted span by `(1 - s)` of the host in a single frame: leave a link 40% drawn
 * and the rule jumps from the first 40% of the word to the last 40%. Guarding the flip
 * behind "only when fully drawn" trades that jump for a worse one, because roughly half of
 * ordinary pass-through sweeps are still in flight when the pointer exits, and those then
 * rewind toward the edge they came from — the opposite of what SCOPE §10's Intent
 * describes, and the Intent is what binds. A span has no such problem: any partial state is
 * representable, so every transition is continuous and the retract always heads for the
 * edge the pointer actually left by. Still transform-only, so still G12.
 *
 * G5, and the reason `armTo` looks the way it does: setting `transition: none` and forcing
 * a reflow *cancels* a running transition, and a cancelled transition reverts to its
 * specified value — the previous target, not the value on screen. Interrupt a draw without
 * pinning first and the rule snaps to full width before it retracts. So `armTo` reads the
 * live span off the matrix, writes it back while transitions are off, and only then arms
 * the new one. Measured: interrupting a 600ms linear draw at 0.333 without the pin lands on
 * 1.0; with it, 0.333.
 *
 * G6 — the rest state is a zero-width span, which is the one place scaling from nothing is
 * right: a rule is progressively revealed from an edge, not popped into existence, and a
 * non-zero rest would leave a permanent dot under the text.
